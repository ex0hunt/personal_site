                        <p>
                            I have studied information security but have always been interested in software development.
                            And, I think, found "holy grail" - writing safe code, without vulnerabilities :)
                            I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member of a team. I especially
                            enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision.
                            I am talkative and sociable but also can concentrating on detailed work like programming.
